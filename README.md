Our use case is the 1SMILE project which stands for Square Mile Infrastructure Leveraged for Emergencies; it targets 'Boda Boda'; a local term for "commercial motorcycles".

Our Value Proposition.
For local first responders seeking to eliminate the Boda-Boda related accidents, 1SMILE is an uber for ambulance service for the 300,000 Boda Boda cyclists and their passengers to monitor the State of Care in Ambulances and Roads (SCAR) as last mile care infrastructure around accident blackspots in Kampala Capital City
By repurposing 1000 'Good Samaritans' into a Community of Purpose for Blackspot Detectives organised in 100 ARTs (Ambulance Response Teams),
Retasking 100 roadside Boda Boda parking stages as ARCs (Ambulance and Rescue Centres) through Guided Mastery of First Aid skills, and 
Retooling 10 Boda Boda motorcycles into BBAs (Boda Boda Ambulances) to deliver paramedics to the accident site within 15 minutes from an ACE (Ambulance Centres of Excellence) on the European Union-funded Northern Bypass by December 2017.


Using statistics from Mulago National Referral Hospital and World Health Organisation, we found that 
Boda-Boda related accidents that are killing and maiming young people at a rate of
