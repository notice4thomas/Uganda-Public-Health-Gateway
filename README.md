# Uganda-Public-Health-Gateway

The repo to contain the Public Health Science Gateway for Ugandans
## Outline

Hi people, you have finally arrived at the Uganda Portal for Public Health. Currently, we are focusing uppacking the concept of Safe Roads as a enabler of a Safe City (see UN Sustainable Development Goal #11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities). We have started with targetting the Boda Boda economy (motorbike transport) which employs so many young men (120,000 motorcycles in Kampala alone; Data available from Kampala Capital City Authority). The boda boda business could be Ugandaâ€™s second largest employer after agriculture. However, this is a worrying trend considering its low contribution to economic growth. 

The 2013 report authored by Standard Bank analyst Simon Freemantle and economist Jeremy Stevens measured motorcycle exports from India to seven African countries including Nigeria, Angola, Uganda Egypt, Kenya, Guinea and Djibouti. The findings indicate Nigeria is the largest importer of motor cycles from India followed by Angola with Uganda coming in at third position (Source:Roland Nasasira, 2016.The Daily Monitor.The boda boda economy defining the streets of Kampala.http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Prosper/boda-boda-economy-defining-streets-Kampala/688616-2869756-d4bwbo/index.html).

However, with the increase of Boda Bodas has come the rise in boda boda related accidents; especially head injuries. At Mulago National Referral Hospital, a casualty ward was created for victims of boda boda accidents; it is populated by so many riders with broken bones. The real question is: "Where do most of the boda boda passengers end up since they usually do not have the chance of jumping off before the accident proves fatal?" Many are crushed under the wheels of passing traffic especially after the headbump renders them unconscious.

## Motivation
With the support of Sci-GaIA (the African Science Gateway), a project codenamed MALAIKA (Angel) is underway seeking to RETASK commuters and drivers to become first responders, RETOOL the emergency health architecture with modular vehicles eg, modular UAV/unmanned aerial vehicles, and REPURPOSE vehicles of wellwishers into temporary ambulances especially in the Golden Hour. It is designed around  extreme citizen science and the golden hour; using the Sci-GaiA platform to crowdsource citizen journalist reports (riders, commuters and drivers) on road accidents in Uganda with a view of supporting the journey towards safe cities and then smart cities. This project is in line with Uganda's Vision2040 that contains plans to create a National Ambulance Service and National Health Insurance Scheme.
